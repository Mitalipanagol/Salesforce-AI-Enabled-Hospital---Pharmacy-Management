# AI-Enabled Hospital & Pharmacy Management (Salesforce Project)

---

## Project Overview
The **AI-Enabled Hospital & Pharmacy Management** is a Salesforce-based healthcare management system designed to digitize and centralize hospital and clinic operations. The system simplifies appointment scheduling, medicine inventory management, billing, and patient history tracking.

It also leverages **AI-driven features** to predict medicine stock requirements, suggest alternatives for unavailable medicines, and optimize operational workflows. The goal is to reduce manual effort, prevent stockouts and expiries, enhance patient experience with automated reminders, and provide administrators with real-time insights into appointments, revenue, and inventory trends.

## 1️. Requirement Gathering

### **Problem Statement**
* Manual appointment scheduling leads to overlaps, missed slots, and inefficiencies.
* Medicine inventory is not tracked in real-time, causing wastage due to expired medicines.
* Billing (consultation, pharmacy, insurance) is error-prone and time-consuming.
* Patients often forget appointments or medicine pickups.
* Administrators lack centralized dashboards to monitor operations, revenue, and stock trends.

## Solution

AI-Enabled Hospital & Pharmacy Management leverages Salesforce to:

* Automate appointment booking with availability checks and reminders.
* Track medicine inventory and expiry, with alerts or automatic reordering.
* Streamline billing, including insurance and pharmacy charges.
* Maintain complete patient history and prescriptions.
* Provide dashboards and reports for administrators to monitor trends and operations.
* Implement role-based access for doctors, nurses, pharmacists, patients, and admins.
* Utilize AI to predict stock needs, suggest alternatives, and optimize hospital workflows.

## 3️. Business Process Mapping

### **Current Manual Process**
1. Patients call or visit the hospital/clinic to book appointments.  
2. Medicine inventory is tracked manually; expired or low-stock medicines may be missed.  
3. Billing is done on paper, including consultation fees, pharmacy charges, and insurance claims.  
4. Appointment and medicine reminders are inconsistent or absent.  
5. Reports and analytics are compiled manually using spreadsheets.  

### **Proposed Salesforce Process (CareFlow)**

| **Action**                  | **Old Process**                    | **CareFlow Process** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Appointment Booking           | Phone calls or in-person visits   | Patients book via LWC; system prevents overlaps |
| Medicine Stock Monitoring     | Manual spreadsheets               | Real-time tracking; AI predicts low stock and sends alerts |
| Billing & Insurance           | Manual calculation and paperwork | Automated calculations via Salesforce; insurance rules applied |
| Reminders                     | Staff follow-ups                  | Automatic email/SMS reminders for appointments and medicine pickups |
| Reports / Analytics           | Monthly spreadsheet compilation   | Real-time dashboards for administrators and staff |
| Patient Access                | Delayed and indirect updates      | Real-time access through Salesforce portal or mobile app |

## 4️. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

Studying existing healthcare and hospital management systems to understand industry trends and identify gaps.

| **Platform / System**                | **Key Features**                                    | **Gap Identified** |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Generic Hospital Management Systems  | Appointment scheduling, billing, basic inventory | Often not integrated end-to-end; limited predictive analytics |
| Pharmacy Inventory Software          | Stock tracking, batch and expiry management       | Lacks integration with appointments, billing, and patient history |
| Telemedicine Apps                     | Remote consultations, scheduling                  | Do not handle inventory, billing, or comprehensive patient data |
| Salesforce Health Cloud               | Patient management, analytics, appointments      | Too complex for smaller hospitals or clinics; expensive and broad |

**Why AI-Enabled Hospital & Pharmacy Management Stands Out:**  
- Combines **appointments, inventory, billing, and patient history** in a single Salesforce platform.  
- Includes **AI-driven features** for stock prediction and alternative medicine suggestions.  
- Lightweight, **user-friendly**, and specifically designed for **small to medium healthcare setups**.  
- Provides **real-time dashboards and automated reminders**, improving operational efficiency and patient experience.

## 5️. AppExchange Exploration

Evaluating existing Salesforce apps to identify suitable solutions and gaps for healthcare management.

| **App Name**                     | **Key Features**                                | **Why Not Fully Suitable** |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Salesforce Health Cloud           | Patient management, appointments, analytics    | Too broad and complex for small hospitals or clinics; costly |
| MedTracker / Pharmacy Inventory Apps | Medicine stock tracking, batch & expiry management | Not integrated with appointment scheduling, billing, or patient history |
| Appointment Scheduling Apps       | Online booking and reminders                     | Lacks medicine inventory management and billing integration |
| Billing & Insurance Apps          | Automated billing and insurance processing      | Often standalone; no integration with patient history or inventory |

**Conclusion:**  
Existing AppExchange solutions either address only part of the problem or are too complex for smaller hospitals and clinics.  
**AI-Enabled Hospital & Pharmacy Management fills the gap** by providing a **comprehensive, integrated Salesforce solution** for appointments, inventory, billing, patient history, and AI-powered stock management.
